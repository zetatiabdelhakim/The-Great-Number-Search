        <h1>RULES</h1>
        <p>&#9813;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All players must select a number between 0 and 100.</li>
            <li>The player who chooses the number closest to the average of all numbers multiplied by 0.8 wins.</li>
            <li>All participants commence with a score of zero, and each time they fail, their score will decrease by one.</li>
            <li>A player whose score reaches negative ten will be eliminated from the game.</li>
            <li>In certain segments of the game, additional rules may be introduced.</li>
            <li>In each round, players are allotted three minutes to make their choice.</li>
            <li>If a selection isn't made by the end of the designated time period, it will be assumed that the previously selected value (in this case, 99 in the first round) will be the one in use.</li>
        </ul>
